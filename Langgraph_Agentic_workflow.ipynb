is a hugely popular programming language, but like any language, it has its strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n\\n* **Readability and Ease of Use:** Python\\'s syntax is clear, concise, and emphasizes readability.  This makes it easier to learn, especially for beginners, and reduces development time.  The code is often described as \"almost like plain English.\"\\n* **Large and Active Community:** A massive community provides extensive support, numerous libraries, and frameworks.  If you encounter a problem, chances are someone else has already solved it and shared the solution online.\\n* **Extensive Libraries and Frameworks:**  Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries for almost any task imaginable, from web development (Django, Flask) to data science (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) to machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and more. This saves developers significant time and effort.\\n* **Versatility:** Python is used in a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, scripting, automation, game development, and more. This versatility makes it a valuable skill for many different roles.\\n* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python code can generally run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) with minimal or no modifications.\\n* **Open Source and Free:** Python is freely available and has an open-source license, making it accessible to everyone.\\n* **Rapid Prototyping:** Python\\'s ease of use and extensive libraries allow for rapid prototyping and development of applications.\\n\\n\\n**Cons:**\\n\\n* **Speed:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning its code is executed line by line, making it generally slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java.  This can be a significant drawback for performance-critical applications.  However, this can often be mitigated by using optimized libraries or extending performance-critical parts with other languages.\\n* **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** The GIL in CPython (the most common implementation of Python) allows only one thread to hold control of the Python interpreter at any one time. This limits true multi-threading performance, although multiprocessing can be used to overcome this limitation.\\n* **Mobile Development Limitations:** Python isn\\'t a primary language for mobile app development. While frameworks like Kivy exist, they\\'re not as widely adopted or powerful as native iOS (Swift/Objective-C) or Android (Kotlin/Java) development.\\n* **Runtime Errors:**  Because Python is dynamically typed, many errors only appear during runtime, which can make debugging more challenging than in statically typed languages.\\n* **Memory Consumption:** Python can be relatively memory-intensive compared to some other languages, especially when dealing with large datasets.\\n* **Weak in Mobile Computing:**  While possible, Python isn\\'t the go-to language for mobile apps.  Other languages are better suited for this purpose.\\n\\n\\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to use Python depends on the specific project requirements and constraints.  Its strengths in readability, versatility, and community support make it an excellent choice for many applications, but its weaknesses in speed and mobile development should be considered.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--e51f0b95-c04c-41d2-94f5-14257fc782d7-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 644, 'total_tokens': 659, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Set Prompt"],"metadata":{"id":"QMWqhoAQTfBc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["default_router_prompt = \"\"\"\n","You are an AI assistant that acts as a router in a chain of llms.\n","Your task is to classify whether the user's question\n","is GENERAL (can be answered with broad, common knowledge) or\n","CSV-RELATED (requires specialized knowledge or information from a csv file).\n","\n","---------------\n","Contraints:\n","---------------\n","- Do not answer the question.
